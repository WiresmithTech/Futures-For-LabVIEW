# Futures for LabVIEW

This repository contains a library with an implementation for futures in LabVIEW.


## :ledger: Description 

Futures and promises are useful tools in creating an asynchronous interface. In LabVIEW this probably means between QMH or Actor loops.

This library contains an implementation of futures for variants which can be used in these interfaces.

## :rocket: Installation

Releases are distributed as  VI packages.
