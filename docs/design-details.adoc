Futures Design Details
======================

== Terminology

Task:: The term for the asynchronous process with a start and end.
Promise:: The API for a task executor to return results and errors.
Future:: The API for a task requestor to recieve results.
Resolved:: The task has been completed with a result or an error.
Cancelled:: The task requestor is no longer interested in a result. 


== Lifetimes

The object with a lifetime is the result object which is shared between the future and the promise.

The future is the sole arbiter of the lifetime of the result. It is cleaned up if the future is destroyed, cancelled or read successfully.

The promise has no control over the lifetime. If the result is destroyed, then the promise will be treated as cancelled with a warning.

In the case of a read timeout - the future user must explicitly clean up the future.
