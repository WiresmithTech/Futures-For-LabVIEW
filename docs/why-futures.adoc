== Asynchronous Programming

In many languages we are seeing an explosion in adoption of asynchronous programming.

Although driven by different factors, we have seen a similar trend in LabVIEW over the past 10 years.
The adoption of architectures which use parallel loops communicating through queues has promoted seperation of concerns and team development but increased the complexity of the systems.

One thing that we can learn from other languages is the potential power of promises and/or futures.

== Promises and Futures

To some degree promises and futures are synonyms which are a placeholder for a value that will be produced at an unknown time in the future.
Some languages use both terms, others use just one.

I like the seperation of using two:

* The asynchronous callee has a promise to fulfil.
* The asynchronous caller has a future value that will be resolved at an unknown time.

The promise can be fulfilled with a result value, or an error.

What does this look like:

.Basic Example

Where there are real gains is if there are multiple requests needed.

.Mutiple Calls (Synchronous vs Asynchronous)
image::multiple_calls.png[Multiple Calls]

Notice in the synchronous version we have two wait periods, one for each call.

With futures we stack up the calls so the waits on the asynchronous processes occur at the same time, reducing the overall execution time.

== Current Solutions in LabVIEW

Currently I see two ways that this gets solved in LabVIEW:

Return Messages:: In this case both the caller and the callee can recieve messages and the caller sends a message back once the operation is completed. 
This can work very well and is the basis of many frameworks. However this might require some additional state management if the caller is in a strange state before getting the response.

Notifiers On Completion:: In some cases a notifier is used to wait on the response. Either baked into the framework call or free to pass around. This is 80% of a futures API and anything we build will be an evolution of this approach.

== What I'm Proposing

1. We start using the language of futures or promises when discussing this approach to getting asynchronous responses. 
A common language will help identify patterns we can use from each other and other languages.

2. In this repository is my idea of what this API looks like. I put it forward as an option for a implementation that solves the problems described above.
